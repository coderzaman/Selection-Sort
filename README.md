# Selection Sort Algorithm in C++

This repository contains a simple implementation of the selection sort algorithm in C++.

## Description

The code consists of two functions:

1. `findMin(vector<int> array)`: This function finds the index of the minimum element in an array and returns it.

2. `selectionSort(vector<int> array)`: This function sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and puts it at the beginning.

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the `selectionSort` function by sorting a vector of integers.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/coderzaman/Selection-Sort
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```
   cd selection-sort-cpp
   ```

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:
   ```
   g++ -o selection_sort selection_sort.cpp
   ```

4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```
   ./selection_sort
   ```

5. The program will output the sorted array.
